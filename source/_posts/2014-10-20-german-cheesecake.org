Recipe for a German cheesecake using /Quark/.  For a 26cm diameter baking pan.

#+HTML: <!-- more -->

** Crust

- 200g flour
- 75g sugar
- 60g butter
- 7g baking powder
- 1 egg
- pinch of salt

Mix thoroughly.  Experience shows to best start with sugar + butter,
then blend in the rest.  The dough will be /very/ dry; it should just
stick together, but crumble apart easily.


** Filling

- 1kg low-fat quark
- 400g milk
- 90g oil (a small cup)
- 200g sugar
- 4 eggs
- 1 pack [[http://www.oetker.de/unsere-produkte/gala/gala-bourbon-vanille.html][vanilla pudding]]
- some drops of vanilla extract
- 1 pack of lemon zest

Blend all ingredients.  To avoid clumps, mix vanilla pudding and some
milk separately first.  The filling will be liquid at this stage.


** Synthesis

Butter the baking pan, coat with flour or breadcrumbs.  Use
approx. half of the dough for the bottom, and half for the sides.
Pull the sides approx. 4cm high.  Now pour the filling into the raw
crust.  Bake at 175Â°C for 75 minutes; if necessary, cover the top with
aluminum foil or baking paper to prevent excessive browning.  Let the
cake cool over night.  Tastes best after a day.


** Discussion

- The dough stretched quite thin first, but in the oven it expanded to the right size.
- The crust came out too poofy for my preferences.
- First day morning, room temperature: I did not quite enjoy the
  texture of the filling.  The texture improved significantly when I
  tried the refrigerated cake in the evening.
