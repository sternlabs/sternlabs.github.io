Recipe for apple cake.  For a 26cm diameter baking pan.

#+HTML: <!-- more -->

** Crust

- 300g flour
- 150g butter
- 75g sugar
- 1 egg
- pinch of salt

Mix thoroughly.  Experience shows to best start with sugar + butter,
then blend in the rest.  The dough will be dry; it should just stick
together, but crumble apart easily.


** Filling

- 750ml apple juice (we juiced apples)
- 2 packs [[http://www.oetker.de/unsere-produkte/gala/gala-bourbon-vanille.html][vanilla pudding]]
- 65g sugar
- some drops of vanilla extract
- 5-8 apples (to make 1.8l of filling)

Prepare the vanilla pudding with the apple juice instead of milk: mix,
heat, etc.  Shred/grate apples into small pieces.  Mix the apple
shreds into the apple vanilla pudding (while still hot).  Add more
apples if you don't have enough filling for your pan.


** Synthesis

Butter the baking pan, coat with flour or breadcrumbs.  Use
approx. half of the dough for the bottom, and half for the sides.
Pull the sides approx. 4cm high.  Now pour the filling into the raw
crust.  Bake at 160Â°C for 60 minutes.  Let the cake cool over night.
